    "t5": "One day, as one of the founders grew weary of navigating between different websites to find info about facilities, a lightbulb moment occurred. Why not consolidate all these systems into one? This way, facilities are free to use whichever system they prefer without fear of missing out on potential players. Simultaneously, players can avoid wasting unnecessary time finding their preferred playing slots. It's a Win-Win!",
